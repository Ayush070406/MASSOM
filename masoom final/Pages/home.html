                AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) <span class="white">AIDS stands for Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome. It is a chronic, potentially life-threatening condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV attacks the immune system, specifically targeting CD4 cells (T cells), which are crucial for fighting off infections and diseases. As the virus destroys more CD4 cells and progresses, the body becomes more susceptible to various infections and cancers.
                    Practice Safe Sex: Use condoms correctly and consistently during sexual intercourse, including vaginal, anal, and oral sex. This reduces the risk of HIV transmission.
                    Limit Sexual Partners: Reducing the number of sexual partners can lower the risk of exposure to HIV.
                    Get Tested Regularly: Knowing your HIV status is crucial. Regular testing helps in early detection and treatment, which can significantly improve outcomes.

Common methods include medication abortion (using pills to end the pregnancy) and surgical abortion (where the contents of the uterus are removed using medical instruments). It's important for individuals considering abortion to consult with healthcare professionals for accurate information and guidance tailored to their specific situation.­</p>
